        <h4>Where Garfield Got His Name</h4>
        <p>Jim Davis, the creator of Garfield, wanted to follow the tradition started by other cartoonists
            <br>of naming a character after a real person. He decided to name his main character after his 
            <br>grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis... who was named after the 20th President of the United
            <br>States, James A. Garfield.
