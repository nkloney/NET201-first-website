        <h2>Get To Know Juneteenth:</h2><br>
        <h4>What is Juneteenth?</h4>
        <p>Juneteenth is "an annual commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States after the Civil War".</p><br>
        <h4>Why is it called Juneteenth?</h4>
        <p>Originating in Galveston, Texas on June 19th, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger
            <br>announced that all slaves were free under the Emancipation Proclamation. This was
            <br>more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the proclamation that
            <br>freed enslaved people in the Confederate states. The proclamation couldn't be
            <br>implemented in areas under Confederate control due to the Civil War, which was
            <br>still happening at the time. The 13th Amendment of the Consititution (the one
            <br>that abolished slavery in the nation) wasn't radified until December 1865.
